# Stock-Price-Prediction---yfinance
Stock price prediction is a crucial aspect of financial analysis, helping investors and traders make informed decisions. This project explores different machine learning and deep learning approaches to forecast the closing prices of major tech stocks (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.


The project employs two deep learning models for prediction:

1- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

A recurrent neural network (RNN) specialized for time-series forecasting, capable of capturing long-term dependencies in stock price movements.
2- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A deep learning model typically used for images, but in this case, adapted for pattern recognition in stock trends.
Key Objectives:

✔ Data Collection: Fetch historical stock prices using Yahoo Finance.

✔ Data Preprocessing: Normalize data and create sequences for model training.

✔ Model Comparison: Train and evaluate LSTM and CNN models to identify the better-performing approach.

✔ Performance Metrics: Compare models using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and visual analysis.

✔ Improvement Strategies: Apply advanced techniques (e.g., hybrid models, hyperparameter tuning) to enhance accuracy.
